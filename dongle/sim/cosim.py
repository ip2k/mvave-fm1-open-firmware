"""Microsecond co-simulation of the dongle model and the ROM model on a shared
open-drain USB pair.

The relay has two positions. With the bus handed to the PC (`dongle.mux_pc`),
the dongle only sees its own side (its pull-ups, its drivers, any board fault)
and the target sees the PC, which is not modelled beyond the chip's own
pull-up. With the relay on the dongle side, both parties share the lines:
0 if anyone drives low, else 1 if any pull-up is present (dongle 2.2 k or the
chip's 1.5 k on D+), else 0 (the chip's 15 k pull-downs).
