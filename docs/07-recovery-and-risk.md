# 07 — Recovery paths, risk register, rules of engagement

The single most important fact about this project: **until a full flash dump
and a byte-identical restore have been demonstrated, every non-stock write to
the FM-1 risks a permanent brick.** This document is the plan to remove that
risk, ranked by how likely each path is to work and how invasive it is.

## 1. Why recovery is hard on this device

- One application bank (`NEW_FLASH_FS` single-backup configuration, no
  double-bank keys in `isd_config.ini`) — AL-255.
- No JTAG/UART header, no test pads, no recovery button — aroum, photos.
- `RESET=PB01_08_0` is a long-press reset, `UPDATE_JUMP=0` selects the reset
  path rather than a mask-ROM jump — AL-255.
- The only vendor update path runs inside the stock application over
  USB-MIDI; a device whose application does not boot cannot be updated that way.
- The stock app exposes no console, CDC, factory mode or recovery chord —
  AL-255's audit of V13/V14.
- Partial safety net [reported: Echomatter, 2026-09-04]: a *running*
  non-stock build that keeps the stock update service reachable can be
  overwritten with a stock package (their `FM-1_016` build with a broken USB
  descriptor was still recoverable through a Windows descriptor filter).
  A build that does not boot, or whose USB or update service is dead, is not.

## 2. Candidate recovery paths, ranked

### 2.1 Mask-ROM USB boot via `USB_KEY` through the USB-C port — try first

The dongle for this is specified, implemented and simulated in docs/10 and
`dongle/`; the bench procedure is docs/10 §6.

**Buy first, build second [added 2026-09-06].** JieLi sells exactly this
dongle: the "JL USB Updater" / "JL Forced Download Tool" (强制升级工具),
versions 2.0–4.0, US$8–18 on AliExpress, Taobao and GoldSupplier (e.g.
AliExpress item 1005007090348648 "Original JL USB Updater 4.0", GoldSupplier
p173085127 at US$8). JieLi's own documentation for the sibling WL83/AC792
family names it as the way into the ROM for chips with built-in flash:
"对于内置FLASH的芯片型号，可以使用杰理强制升级工具" (for chip models with
built-in FLASH, use JieLi's forced upgrade tool; obtainable through
distributors or JieLi's Taobao shop), after which Windows shows
"WL83 UBOOT1.00 USB Device" [reported]. The AC791N/WL82 is the same
generation and the mechanism is the mask ROM's, so it should apply, but the
listings only enumerate the Bluetooth families [inferred]. From the vendor
manual (manuals.plus/ae/1005009768042266): female side into a **USB 2.0 port
on the PC**, male side into the target; **no hubs, docks or USB 3.0 ports**;
the target's MCU must power up while the dongle is attached (our finding that
the FM-1 only starts when its switch is thrown fits: connect first, then
switch on); red LED = power, blue LED = download state; V4 has a DIP switch
(all off for chips with a crystal, which the FM-1 has) and an "update" button.
The FM-1 needs a **USB-A-female-to-USB-C-male adapter** between the dongle's
plug and the synth. The vendor software is Windows-only (`isd_download.exe`,
a *writer*: never run it against the FM-1); for read-only dumps use
`jl-uboot-tool` on a Linux PC once the chip shows up as `UBOOT1.00`
(docs/10 §5). The RP2040 design in docs/10 stays as the open, instrumented
alternative (it logs which polarity worked and every timing step) and is not
being turned into a PCB unless the vendor tool fails on this chip.

JieLi's mask ROM contains a USB bootloader ("UBOOT1.00"). Besides entering it
when the flash fails to boot, the ROM watches for a special signal on the USB
data lines at power-up **[reported: kagaimiq `isp/usb/usb-key.md`,
`jl-uboot-tool/docs/how-to-enter-uboot.md`]**:

- The key is the 16-bit value **`0x16EF`** (`0001 0110 1110 1111`), sent
  MSB-first, one line as clock (data latched on the rising edge), the other as
  data, at roughly **50 kHz** (not critical; reception is bit-banged in ROM),
  repeated until the chip acknowledges by **pulling both D+ and D− low for
  1–2 ms**.
- **The two kagaimiq documents disagree on which line is clock.** `usb-key.md`
  says D+ is clock and D− is data; `how-to-enter-uboot.md` says D− is clock and
  D+ is data. Try both polarities.
- After the ACK the chip pulls D+ up and measures **SOF pulses** to calibrate
  its PLL, so the host bus must be quiet: use a dedicated USB 2.0 hub (an MTT
  hub such as Terminus FE2.1 isolates per port) or a separate host controller,
  and no other full/low-speed devices on it. Noise makes the ROM miscalculate
  the clock, time out on the watchdog and boot from flash instead.
- Then the chip enumerates as a **USB mass-storage device** (`4C4A:xx42`
  pattern on other families; the WL82 PID is unknown) and speaks JieLi's SCSI
  vendor protocol v2. `jl-uboot-tool` loads `wl82loader.bin` to
  `0x1C02000` (with the "MengLi" memory cipher quirk) and can then read, write
  and erase flash and run code (`jlrunner.py`). The vendor's `isd_download`
  does the same (`-dev wl82 -boot 0x1c02000`).
- Hardware needed: a small MCU dongle (RP2040, ESP32, Arduino) that bit-bangs
  the key on the FM-1's D+/D−, senses the ACK with a **strong external pull-up
  (< 4.7 kΩ)** because the chip's 15 kΩ pull-downs defeat MCU-internal pull-ups,
  then hands the bus to the PC (USB mux, or a relay, or a manual re-plug within
  the SOF window). The vendor sells exactly this as the "USB Updater" dongle
  (AC6925B-based) — buying one from Taobao/AliExpress is a legitimate shortcut.
- FM-1 specifics to check: any series resistors or ESD parts between the USB-C
  connector and the SoC. Power sequencing is settled: with the slide switch off
  the unit does not enumerate on USB power at all [verified 2026-09-06], so the
  ROM starts when the switch is thrown and the key must already be on the lines
  at that moment (the dongle keys continuously).

**Why this is the priority:** it needs no soldering, it is the vendor's own
production flashing path, and the tooling already exists. Its only unknown is
whether the AC791N's ROM honours the key on the FM-1's wiring. If it works,
dump the whole 1 MB, verify the dump matches the stock package where it
should, restore it, and dump again.

### 2.2 Failed-boot fallback

The ROM enters USB download mode by itself if the flash does not boot
**[reported: kagaimiq]**. This is a safety net only *after* we can write flash:
a custom firmware that deliberately invalidates its own header on a key combo,
or a watchdog-backed failure counter that erases the app directory head, would
guarantee a way back. It does not help a stock device.

### 2.3 Software entry into ROM USB mode from a running custom app

The SDK's `isd_config.ini` has `UPDATE_JUMP` (reset vs. jump to mask-ROM
update) and the online config tool protocol has a "MaskROM-update entry"
command; the SDK exposes functions to enter USB update mode. **Every custom
firmware must include a robust, early, key-combo-triggered path into this
mode plus a boot-failure counter** (AL-255's P0 "fail-open boot path"). The
stock app has no reachable equivalent.

### 2.4 `UART_KEY` / ISP / debug TAP over soldered wires

If `USB_KEY` fails: the LQFP48 leads are solderable. The SDK ini comments name
UART update pins `PB00`, `PB05`, `PA05` and debug-TAP options `PA9/PA10`,
`PB1/PB2`, `PB6/PB7` (or the USB pins). kagaimiq documents `UART_KEY` and the
ISP key. Requires the pinout from the AC7911B datasheet in the SDK and steady
hands; still far better than nothing.

### 2.5 External flash programmer

Only if the flash is a discrete chip. The photos show one candidate: a
bottom-side SOIC-8 (`U12`?) near the connectors next to a 0.1 Ω resistor,
which reads more like a charger IC than a flash [inferred, 2026-09-08]. If
its marking turns out to be a `25Qxx`-class SPI NOR, a clip and a cheap
programmer become the simplest recovery path of all; read it on the bench
(docs/09 §5).

## 3. Risk register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Custom package bricks the only device | high if attempted before recovery | total loss of the unit | **do not flash non-stock before 2.1 is proven**; buy a second FM-1 or an AC791N dev board (JL_AC79_DevKit V1.0) for first experiments |
| `USB_KEY` does not work on AC791N through the connector | medium | forces soldering (2.4) | try both clock/data polarities, quiet bus, dev-board rehearsal |
| Wrong loader / wrong chip family in tooling | medium | corrupt flash | jl-uboot-tool marks WL82 "unknown": read-only operations first, compare dump with the stock package before any write |
| Interrupted write (power loss, USB drop) | medium | unbootable app | battery charged, no hubs during writes, dump before every write |
| Verifier gate never explained | medium | no cable-only install for users; development unaffected | ship a "one-time unlock" via dongle if needed; keep researching with a recoverable device |
| Toolchain download disappears | low–medium | cannot build | archive the toolchain privately (do not publish) |
| Legal complaint about redistributing vendor binaries | low | takedown | never commit `.fwsc`/`app.bin`; link to sources |
| Bluetooth radio regulatory issues with custom firmware | low | none for personal use | keep vendor BT stack or disable BT |

## 4. Rules of engagement (adopted from AL-255's safety review)

1. No non-stock flash on any device without a proven dump-and-restore path for
   that device.
2. Keep `uboot.boot`, `ota.bin`, `cfg`, `isd_config.ini` and the partition
   layout **byte-identical to stock** in any experimental package until the
   loader checks are understood.
3. Never send syscmd commands 33–36 or 48; never send the `5A AA A5` online-tool
   erase/write commands blind.
4. Every custom firmware carries a fail-open boot path (key combo → USB update
   mode) and a watchdog-backed failure counter from day one.
5. Test power loss and disconnects at every update stage on the recoverable
   device before anyone else is told to flash anything.
6. Read the stock identity (`FM-1_0xx`) from the device/package; never infer
   version from filenames.
7. Log everything on the bench: USB descriptors, SysEx traces, dumps with
   SHA-256, photos of pin probes. Put them under `notes/`.
