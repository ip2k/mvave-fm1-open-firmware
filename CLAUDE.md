# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code working in this repo.

## What this is

Research and, later, code toward an open-source firmware for the **M-VAVE FM-1**
(JieLi AC791N SoC, pi32v2 CPU, msfa/Dexed FM engine). Status: **research phase
complete; one read-only bench session done (`notes/2026-09-06-bench.md`);
nothing flashed.** The owner's unit runs `FM-1_015`. The `USB_KEY` recovery
dongle (docs/10, `dongle/`) is implemented and simulated, not yet tried.
Elsewhere, Echomatter ran a version-bumped V15-derived package on their FM-1
via the stock OTA path and rolled it back (AL-255 PR #2, 2026-09-04). `HANDOFF.md` is the context summary; `README.md`
has the verdict; `docs/` has the detail.

This project is unrelated to the BUSY Bar timer repo it was briefly hosted in.

## The one rule

**Nothing gets flashed to, or written on, the FM-1 until a full flash dump and a
byte-identical restore have been demonstrated on that unit.** There is one
device, one flash bank, no debug pads, and no proven recovery path. The only
traffic allowed before that is the read-only identity query
`F0 00 32 45 00 00 00 40 7F F7` and passive captures. See `docs/07` §4 for the
full rules of engagement; they come from AL-255's safety review and are not
negotiable without new evidence.

## Hardware in one table

| | |
| --- | --- |
| SoC | JieLi AC791N (WL82), LQFP48, marking `C156211-11B8`; pi32v2 core, 240 MHz used of 320; 578 KB SRAM; 1 MB flash (probably in-package) |
| Memory map | flash XIP `0x02000000`, RAM `0x01C00000`, SFRs `0x1xxxx…0x5xxxx`, mask ROM `0xFFC0xxxx` |
| USB | normal `4C4A:C755` (USB-MIDI + UAC1, full-speed, product string `FM-1`), OTA loader `4D4A:4155` |
| Display | 240×240 RGB565 TFT on SPI1 (`0x11D00`), ST7789-class commands |
| Controls | 27 keys + ~14 LED buttons in a 41-input matrix; 8 knobs (stock reads 2 encoders + 2 ADC channels; split unresolved) |
| Audio | internal DAC, 44.1 kHz, 64-sample blocks; 12 msfa voices |
| Update | USB-MIDI SysEx, CRC16 only; stock verifier rejects rebuilt packages |

## Commands

```bash
python3 tools/check_msfa_table.py path/to/app.bin            # msfa table finder (tested on V13/V14)
python3 tools/extract_fwsc_from_updater.py M-UPGRADE-FM1 -o FM-1.fwsc   # carve package from the updater
python3 reference/jl-misctools/firmware/fwunpack_newfw.py FM-1.fwsc     # unpack (needs: pip install crcmod)
python tools/fm1_identify.py                                   # read-only identity query + decode, any OS (verified on hardware)
python -m pytest                                               # tools, PIO emulation and dongle/ROM co-simulation tests
tools/fm1_identify.sh                                          # Linux, ALSA raw MIDI, read-only, untested
python3 reference/FM-1-RE/tools/fm1_ota.py scan                # AL-255's client, read-only scan
```

`reference/` and `scratch/` are git-ignored; clone third-party repos and keep
vendor packages there.

## Conventions

- **Confidence marks in every technical claim:** `[verified]` (checked here
  against binaries, photos or SDK files), `[reported]` (named source, not
  re-checked), `[inferred]`. Never upgrade a claim without doing the check.
- **Never commit vendor binaries** (`.fwsc`, `app.bin`, `uboot.boot`, the JieLi
  toolchain, updater apps). `.gitignore` blocks the common ones; link to
  sources instead.
- Credit prior work by name (aroum, AL-255, kagaimiq, probonopd, Google msfa,
  Dexed family, Schwung/Movy). Quote, summarize and link; do not copy whole
  documents or photos (aroum's repo has no license).
- Docs are numbered `docs/NN-topic.md`; bench results go to
  `notes/YYYY-MM-DD-*.md`; answered open questions are removed from `docs/01`
  §6 and the answer written where it belongs.
- Read the device identity (`FM-1_0xx`) from the package or device; never infer
  a version from a filename (the "V13" package identifies as `FM-1_009`).
- Future firmware code: C/C++11 for JieLi's clang (`-fno-exceptions -fno-rtti`),
  built against the Apache-2.0 AC79 SDK; msfa/Synth_Dexed for the engine; keep
  `uboot.boot`, `ota.bin`, `cfg` and the partition layout byte-identical to
  stock in any experimental package until the verifier gate is understood.

## Traps that have already cost people time

1. **`JL-BR22` in the binary is not the SoC.** It is Bluetooth-library lineage;
   the chip is AC791N/WL82 (package ID, SPL match). Register maps borrowed from
   BR2x docs are unsafe until checked against `WL82.h`.
2. **The stock updater is not a recovery tool.** It needs the stock app
   running and has never installed a non-stock image; `0xF0000000/"success"`
   is a terminal acknowledgement, not authorization.
3. **kagaimiq's two `USB_KEY` write-ups disagree** on which USB line is the
   clock. Try both.
4. **ghidra-jieli mis-decodes the `80 ff` long-call prefix**; use the vendor
   `objdump` from the JieLi Linux toolchain as the source of truth.
5. **Raw MIDI on Linux is unusable while PipeWire/JACK/aseq hold the port**;
   the updater and AL-255's client use the ALSA sequencer.
6. **Version numbers are inconsistent** between filenames, marketing (V09/V14/
   V15) and the identity string. Always read the identity.
7. **Do not send syscmd 33–36 or 48** or any `5A AA A5` online-tool frame; some
   copy memory or touch flash.
8. **Movy/Schwung are Linux-only by nature**; do not plan around porting them.
